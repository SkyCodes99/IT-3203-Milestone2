    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>This website serves as the first for the IT3203 project. Its primary goal is to demonstrate the creation of a well-structured, multi-page website using semantic HTML and a single, responsive CSS file. The content topic—The Environmental Impact of LLMs—will be expanded and refined in subsequent project phases.</p>
